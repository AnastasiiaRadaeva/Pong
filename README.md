# Pong project
Your work has to comply with the following rules:
- Your website backend must be written in NestJS.
- The frontend must be written with a TypeScript framework of your choice.
- You are free to use any library you want to in this context. However, you must use
the latest stable version of every library or framework used in your project.
- You must use a PostgreSQL database. Thatâ€™s it, no other database.
# Game part
- Users should be able to play a live Pong game versus another player
directly on the website.
- There must be a matchmaking system: the user can join a queue until they get
automatically matched with someone else.
- It can be a canvas game, or it can be a game rendered in 3D, it can also be ugly,
but in any case, it must be faithful to the original Pong (1972).
- You must offer some customization options (for example, power-ups or different
maps). However, the user should be able to select a default version of the game
without any extra features if they want to.
- The game must be responsive!
- The user should be able to watch a live play between other users without interfering
with it.
